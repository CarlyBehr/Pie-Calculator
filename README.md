# Pie-Calculator
The calculator continuously updates, showing how the approximation of π gets more accurate as more terms are added to the series.

I've created an animated calculator that:

Calculates π using the Leibniz formula
Shows the current approximation of π
Displays each term of the series as it's being calculated
Uses a blue and orange color scheme where:

Deep blue for the calculator body
Light blue for the main display
Orange for the equation terms and progress bar


Features:

Updates every second
Shows up to 20 terms before resetting
Includes a progress bar
Displays the current number of terms calculated
Shows the running approximation with 8 decimal places
